          Natural disasters are the result of a hazard overwhelming highly
          vulnerable community, often resulting in mortality and morbidity. Over
          the past decade, over 300 natural disasters occur yearly around the
          world affecting millions and cost billions. The disaster cycle is a
          framework used to base a coordinated plan to respond, recover,
          prevent, and prepare for a disaster. In this critical moment the
          access of pure water, food, shelter,medicine and necessary items
          becomes very tough to mass people that's why our team works for
          people's welfare. We are having 200+ volunteers in our organisation
          accross the country and still we are recruiting volunteers
          continuously. If you are interested to be a part of our mission of
          trying to make a smile on people's face, you are WELCOME!
